        ------------
        
        ### Runtime
        
        -   python3
        -   python3-dulwich
        -   python3-retrying
        -   python3-swh.core
        -   python3-swh.model
        -   python3-swh.storage
        -   python3-swh.scheduler
        
        ### Test
        
        -   python3-nose
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -   implementation language, Python3
        -   coding guidelines: conform to PEP8
        -   Git access: via dulwich
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You can run the loader from a remote origin (*loader*) or from an
        origin on disk (*from_disk*) directly by calling:
        
        
        ```
        python3 -m swh.loader.git.{loader,from_disk}
        ```
        
        ### Location
        
        Both tools expect a configuration file.
        
        Either one of the following location:
        - /etc/softwareheritage/
        - ~/.config/swh/
        - ~/.swh/
        
        Note: Will call that location $SWH_CONFIG_PATH
        
        ### Configuration sample
        
        Respectively the loader from a remote (`git.yml`) and the loader from
        a disk (`git-disk.yml`), $SWH_CONFIG_PATH/loader/git{-disk}.yml:
        ```
        storage:
          cls: remote
          args:
            url: http://localhost:5002/
        ```
