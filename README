bin/swh-loader-git takes one argument: a configuration file in .ini format.

The configuration file contains the following directives:

```
[main]
# the storage class used. one of remote_storage, local_storage
storage_class = remote_storage

# arguments passed to the storage class
# for remote_storage: URI of the storage server
storage_args = http://localhost:5000/

# for local_storage: database connection string and root of the
# storage, comma separated
# storage_args = dbname=softwareheritage-dev, /tmp/swh/storage

# The path to the repository to load
repo_path = /tmp/git_repo

# The URL of the origin for the repo
origin_url = https://github.com/hylang/hy

# The ID of the authority that dated the validity of the repo
authority = 1

# The validity date of the refs in the given repo, in Postgres
# timestamptz format
validity = 2015-01-01 00:00:00+00

# Whether to send the given types of objects
send_contents = True
send_directories = True
send_revisions = True
send_releases = True
send_occurrences = True

# The size of the packets sent to storage for each kind of object
content_packet_size = 100000
directory_packet_size = 25000
revision_packet_size = 100000
release_packet_size = 100000
occurrence_packet_size = 100000
```

bin/swh-loader-git-multi takes the same arguments, and adds:

```
[main]
# database connection string to the lister-github database
lister_db = dbname=lister-github

# base path of the github repositories
repo_basepath = /srv/storage/space/data/github

# Whether to run the mass loading or just list the repos
dry_run = False

```
